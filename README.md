# oznu/dns-ad-blocker

A simple, lightweight, Dnsmasq DNS server to block traffic to known ad servers.

## Usage

```
docker run -d -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp oznu/dns-ad-blocker
```

## AD Blocking

This image is using the blacklists created by [oznu/dns-zone-blacklist](https://github.com/oznu/dns-zone-blacklist) and [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts). The blacklist is updated every time the container is restarted.

## Optional :: Custom Domains

This image supports adding additional zones that may be used to serve internal DNS zones or to override existing zones.

To do this create a volume share when creating the container:

```
docker run -d -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp -v /srv/zones:/etc/dnsmasq.d/ oznu/dns-ad-blocker
```

Every file in the ```/srv/zones``` will be included as an extension to the Dnsmasq config.

Example:

```
# Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
# The example below send any host in doubleclick.net to a local
# webserver.
address=/doubleclick.net/127.0.0.1

# Return an MX record named "maildomain.com" with target
# servermachine.com and preference 50
mx-host=maildomain.com,servermachine.com,50
```

After adding or updating a zone config file you must restart the container for it to be loaded.
